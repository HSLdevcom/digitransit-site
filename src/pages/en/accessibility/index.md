# Accessibility statement

This accessibility statement applies to digitransit journey planner. The statement has been created on 1.6.2022. The statement is based on reports from multiple external accessibility experts.

## State of accessibility

The digitransit journey planner is partly compliant with the accessibility requirements. We are constantly working on making the service as accessible as possible.

The content below is not accessible in accordance with WCAG criteria for the following reasons:

### General

- Map and its contents are not navigable or readable using a screen reader (WCAG 1.1.1, 2.1.1)

### Itinerary suggestions -page

- The focus of screen reader can move to a wrong itinerary in the itinerary view when selecting a single itinerary (WCAG 2.4.3)

- Alerts that inform the users of changed content do not work on all screen readers (WCAG 4.1.3)

- Selecting a single itinerary on the itineraries page causes the focus to stay in the middle of the page when the content changes (WCAG 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 2.4.3)

### Route -page

- The route page contains data that is only conveyed visually. Following a single trip in real-time does not provide real-time information to screen readers (WCAG 1.3.1, 1.4.1)
