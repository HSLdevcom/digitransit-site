Map API provides raster map images (background map) and other points of interests like rental stations and park and ride areas as vector maps.

[Background map](./background-map/) API provides raster map tiles that are shared amongst many HSL's applications. Raster map style has been designed to work as "generic HSL map style".

[Points of interest](./pois/) API provides vector map tiles that can be displayed on top of background raster map.
