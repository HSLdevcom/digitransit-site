Preview APIs are previews of new APIs that will be introduced in future releases.
These APIs can be for example drafts without actual implementation or they can be functional preliminary versions of upcoming APIs. Preview APIs provide developers visibility to future changes and allow them to give feedback before the release.

**Note:** Preview APIs can change before release.

**Note:** Preview APIs may have links to [GraphiQL](../1-graphiql) examples which run in Digitransit development server. Please don't use the development server for production applications as the development server is not meant to handle large amount of traffic and the APIs may change frequently.
