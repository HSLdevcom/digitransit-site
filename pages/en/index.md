    body: You are the focus, always. The next generation journey planner pinpoints your location and shows nearby routes, stops and timetables, in real time! Real time means that you will see the location of buses and trains, as well as the accurate times of arrival at the stops. No more time wasted waiting. The service filters unnecessary information and tells what is going on around you and how to get to your destination more conveniently. In the future, the real time service will cover the whole country.

You’ll be using state-of-the-art browser technology and will soon become familiar with the development environment. Roll up your sleeves and download Digitransit. The code is open-source.

Digitransit is an easy-to-access service platform provided by HSL, the Finnish Transport Agency and TVV LMJ Oy. Thanks to its open-source nature, all interested parties can participate in the development of the service. This is likely to result in better quality, improve security and provide data that is always up-to-date. Make sure that the route and timetable information for your municipality are available for the service platform.
