title: Getting started

We know that sometimes public transport does not work according to timetables. Sometimes vehicles arrive earlier, sometimes later, and sometimes not at all.
What to do? Real time information to the rescue!

Real time information is an umbrella term for data that is based on vehicle movements and alerts generated by human operators and automatic systems. Let's define some terms:

**Vehicle position** is vehicle's real geographic position, represented by latitude and longitude.

**Realtime prediction** based on vehicles planner route and it's current position some system makes a prediction when vehicle really arrives to some point

**Service alert** is a description about a disruption that happens in public transport

### GTFS-Realtime

[GTFS-Realtime](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) (or GTFS-RT) is a standard for transportation agencies to provide realtime updates about their fleet.
It provides three kinds of feeds:

- [Trip updates](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/trip-updates)
- [Service alerts](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/service-alerts)
- [Vehicle positions](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/vehicle-positions)

Our goal is to provide GTFS-RT feeds for you.

## About the API
Heavy lifting of realtime data is done in other systems. Digitransit integrates itself to various datasources in order
to read realtime data from the vehicles. How this is done depends on which region we are talking about.

### Realtime predictions are available in Routing API
Realtime data is read into the [Routing API](../../1-routing-api/). This means that Routing API returns results that contain
predictions. Read more in Routing API docs.

### Situation in HSL
Current Digitransit implementation is a "partially working solution" built on top of legacy APIs. This means that:
- Not all vehicles have realtime information available
- There might be mysterious bugs lurking in realtime the data

Note that this is not the final solution. In the near future new ticketing and information system will replace all
legacy components related to HSL realtime. This transition will improve situation considerably. Read more at:

If you are really intrested in implementing some realtime features, you should look at
[Digitransit-ui](../../5-digitransit-ui/) and it's [source code](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/digitransit-ui). That way
you can get idea how realtime is used there.

## Situation in Finnish Transport Agency
Currently, FTA provides realtime information for trains at http://rata.digiraffic.fi . We have a simple wrapper
(raildigiraffic2gtfsrt) that transforms that data to GTFS-RT trip updates.

Finnish Transport Agency is investigating possibility to build National realtime service which would collect realtime
data from all around the Finland.

## Situation in other cities
We don't have that much control over other cities and the data they provide. We have integrated e.g. data from Oulu
just to see how it behaves.
