| Term                   | Explanation                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Agency                 | Some public transport provider, e.g. HSL. |
| Route                  | A public transport service shown to customers under a single name, usually from point A to B and back. For example: trams 1 and 1A, buses 18 and 102T, or train A. Commonly used synonym: line |
| Pattern		 | A sequence of stops as used by a specific direction and variant of a route. For example a tram entering/departing service from/to the depot usually joins at the middle of the route, or a route might have a short term diversion (poikkeusreitti) without changing the route name (longer diversions are usually marked as different routes). |
| Trip                   | A specific occurance of a route, usually identified by the route and exact departure time from the first stop. For example bus 102 leaving from Otaniemi on 2017-11-21 10:00, or more generally leaving from Otaniemi at 10:00 on specified days (e.g. from Monday to Friday from 2017-11-20 to 2017-11-24 excluding holidays). |
| Stop                   | A public transport stop, from which passengers can board vehicles. |
| Stoptime               | Arrival or departure time at a stop. |
| Departure row          | A special location type, which lists departures of a certain pattern from a stop. Departures rows are identified with pattern id, so querying departure rows will return departures only from one stop per pattern. |
| Station                | A location, which contains stops. For example, a train station is a station and its platforms are stops. | 
| Cluster                | A list of stops, grouped by name and proximity. |
| Disruption (Alert)     | A temporary change in public transport. For example, a stop out-of-use or diversion on a route. |
