title: Routing API

Routing API provides a way to plan itineraries and query public transportation related
information about stops and timetables.

## Getting started

At first you should read the [GraphQL](./0-graphql/) and [GraphiQL](./1-graphiql/) pages and try out the examples provided.

It is also recommended to read the [Realtime arrival prediction](./2-realtime-arrival-prediction/) page before going any further.

After this, you are ready to run queries for routes, stops, bicycling routes, city bikes, disruption info and do itinerary planning.
