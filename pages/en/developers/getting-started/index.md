title: Getting started
---

First you should decide "what do you want to get started with?". You have multiple options:

1. Test drive Digitransit-ui
2. Use Digitransit APIs in your application
3. Make modifications to Digitransit-ui web app
4. Try out Docker images

## Test drive Digitransit-ui
This is easiest way to get started. Read [Digitransit-ui documentation](../service-catalogue/digitransit-ui/) and how to start start Digitransit-ui in Docker.

## Use available APIs in your application
Read documentation about architecture and environment urls:
- [Architecture](../architecture/)
- [Environments](../architecture/environments/)

Then read about public APIs:
- [Routing - API](../service-catalogue/apis/routing-api/)
- [Geocoding - API ](../service-catalogue/apis/geocoding-api/)
- [Map - API](../service-catalogue/apis/map-api/)
- [Realtime - API](../service-catalogue/apis/realtime-api/)

This will help you get started. Articles page might contain something useful:
- [Articles](../articles/)

## Make modifications to Digitransit-ui web app
Start by reading architecture tutorial and installation instructions:
- [Digitransit-ui](../service-catalogue/digitransit-ui/)
- [Installation instructions](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/digitransit-ui/blob/master/docs/Installation.md)

## Try out Docker images
See more information from [Docker guide.](docker-guide/)
