title: Realtime data
---

Routing API backend is connected to vechicle realtime information for some vehicles. This means that API queries can return **realTime: true** parameter.

When this happens, it means that time is measured from the actual vehicle and represents (more or less) exact moment when vehicle will arrive.

**Note!** This is not completely bullet proof yet.
