First you should decide "what do you want to get started with?". You have multiple options:

1. Test drive Digitransit-ui
2. Use Digitransit APIs in your application
3. Make modifications to Digitransit-ui web app

## Test drive Digitransit-ui
This is easiest way to get started. Read [web ui documentation](../web-ui/) and how to start start Digitransit-ui in Docker.

## Use available APIs in your application
Read documentation about architecture and environment urls:
- [Architecture](../architecture/)
- [Environments](../environments/)

Then read about APIs:
- [Routing - API](../routing-api/)
- [Geocoding - API ](../geocoding-api/)
- [Map - API](../map-api/)
- [Alerts HSL - API](../alerts-hsl-api/)
- [Realtime HSL - API](../realtime-hsl-api/)

This will help you get started. Articles page might contain something useful:
